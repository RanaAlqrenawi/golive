# Golive

### Golive is an online platform that helps the non-tech users to start their own website.

### This is an ASP.net platform that goes with the users through some screens where they add information and select features about the website they are looking for.

### The project was developed as team working in the Angel Hack Hackathon in 2016 whereby, I won the prize of the best tech team leader.
